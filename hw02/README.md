## Progress Report
I make all files for the STAT 545 course using Rstudio, which I have syched to my Github account. For the markdown files, I start with an R markdown document, which I knit into markdown. Git makes version control a breeze, and allows me to access my files accross multiple devices. Git also acts as a conventient back-up, in case files are lost on my local machine.

For this assignment, I found that googling my problems was the best way to find solutions. However, [Jenny's ggplot2 tutorial](https://github.com/jennybc/ggplot2-tutorial) was absolutely indispensible. As well, the [cm005 class notes](http://stat545.com/cm005-notes_and_exercises.html) were super useful! I'm starting to get a handle on the R syntax now, and I find that piping with `%>%` makes my code much more readable than without!
