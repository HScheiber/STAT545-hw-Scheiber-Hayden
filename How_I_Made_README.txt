This file is a description of how I made changes to my README.md file.

For the first 3 sections, I worked directly on github, making small edits and committing them within the repository. 
I found this process cumbersome as I couldn't see whether or not the changes I made would properly be compiled by markdown.
I found the markdown cheat-sheet (https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) very useful in developing the readme file.
