This file is a description of how I made changes to my README.md and hw01_gapminder.Rmd files...

For the README.md file, I initially worked directly on github, making small edits and committing them within the repository. 
I found this process cumbersome as I couldn't see whether or not the changes I made would properly be compiled by markdown. Soon after I switched to working in Rstudio and the workflow was much smoother.
I found the markdown cheat-sheet (https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) very useful in developing the readme file.



For the gapminder exploration file, I worked solely in Rstudio. I used the git functionality within Rstudio to push the files to github.

Making the R markdown document was very straightforward (although I have quite a bit of coding experience in other languages, so my experience probably played a role). The in-class workshop was crutial in getting to know R markdown.
