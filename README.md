## About me
I am a new chemistry PhD student at the University of British Columbia. I completed my undergrad in bio-organic chemistry at McGill University, graduating in December 2016.
My specialization within chemistry is now physical/computational chemistry. If you would like to view my summer research, you can find it in my Github repository titled ["ALMO-Langevin"](https://github.com/HScheiber/ALMO-Langevin-Manuscript.git "Warning: it's in LaTeX format!").
