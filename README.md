# STAT 545 - Homework Repository

Welcome all visitors to my homework repository, my name is Hayden Scheiber! You can reach me at scheiber@chem.ubc.ca

This repository is where all my homework for the course STAT 545 at UBC can be found.

## About me
I am a new chemistry PhD student at the University of British Columbia. I completed my undergrad in bio-organic chemistry at McGill University, graduating in December 2016.
My specialization within chemistry is now physical/computational chemistry.

## How I made this repository
I make all files for the STAT 545 course using Rstudio, which I have syched to my Github account. This makes version control a breeze, and allows me to access my files accross multiple devices. Git also acts as a conventient back-up, in case files are lost on my local machine.

Thanks for visiting my repository! I'll leave you with a quote that has stuck with me over the years:

> I mean, they say you die twice. One time when you stop breathing and a second 
time, a bit later on, when somebody says your name for the last time.
