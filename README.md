How I made this repository
--------------------------

I make all files for the STAT 545 course using Rstudio, which I have syched to my Github account. For the markdown files, I usually start with an R markdown document, which I knit into markdown. Git makes version control a breeze, and allows me to access my files accross multiple devices. Git also acts as a conventient back-up, in case files are lost on my local machine.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks for visiting my repository! I'll leave you with a quote that has stuck with me over the years:

> I mean, they say you die twice. One time when you stop breathing and a second time, a bit later on, when somebody says your name for the last time.

Â - Banksy
