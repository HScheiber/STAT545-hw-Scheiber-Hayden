# STAT 545 - Homework Assignment 1

Welcome visitors to my repository, my name is Hayden Scheiber! You can reach me at scheiber@chem.ubc.ca

This is assignment 1 for the UBC statistics course STAT 545, in the Fall 2017 term.

## About me
I am a new chemistry PhD student at the University of British Columbia. I completed my undergrad in bio-organic chemistry at McGill University, graduating in December 2016.
My specialization within chemistry is now physical/computational chemistry. If you would like to view my summer research, you can find it in my Github repository titled ["ALMO-Langevin"](https://github.com/HScheiber/ALMO-Langevin-Manuscript.git "Warning: it's in LaTeX format!"). The website for my summer research lab group can be found [here](http://khaliullin.com/ "Check out 'Team and Openings' to see a picture of me").

Over the summer, I did research on __*Ab initio* Molecular Dynamics__. I worked on developing a new faster method of calculating the electronic structure for the system of interest. My results, posted below, show that we were able to retain fairly good accuracy of bulk properties!

## Gapminder Exploration
[Here](hw01_gapminder.md "Gapminder Exploration") you can check out my exploration of the Gapminder dataset, which is a massive UN database that compares the populations, gdp per capita, and life expectancy for most countries in 5 year incriments between 1952 and 2007.
