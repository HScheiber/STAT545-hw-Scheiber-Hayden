# STAT 545 - Homework Assignment 1

Welcome visitors to my repository, my name is Hayden Scheiber! You can reach me at scheiber@chem.ubc.ca

This is assignment 1 for the UBC statistics course STAT 545, in the Fall 2017 term.

## About me
I am a new chemistry PhD student at the University of British Columbia. I completed my undergrad in bio-organic chemistry at McGill University, graduating in December 2016.
My specialization within chemistry is now physical/computational chemistry. If you would like to view my summer research, you can find it in my Github repository titled ["ALMO-Langevin"](https://github.com/HScheiber/ALMO-Langevin-Manuscript.git "Warning: it's in LaTeX format!").

Over the summer, I did research on *Ab initio* Molecular Dynamics. I worked on developing a new faster method of calculating the electronic structure for the system of interest. My results, posted below, show that we were able to retain fairly good accuracy of bulk properties!
