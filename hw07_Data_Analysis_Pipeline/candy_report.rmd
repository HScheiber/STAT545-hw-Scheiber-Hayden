Welcome! This is the 7th homework assignment for the STAT 545+547M course. In this assignment, I build an automated data analysis pipline using the program `GNU Make`. A link to the assignment itself can be found [here](http://stat545.com/hw07_automation.html "STAT 545 Assignment 7").

For this assignment, I decided that I was bored of exploring the gapminder data. So I tried my hand at exploring the [2015 candy survey data](http://www.scq.ubc.ca/2015-candy-hierarchy-supplemental-raw-data-and-new-analyses/), which I did not explore for assignment 6. Below are the libraries needed to run this R markdown file:
```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(knitr))
```


## Downloading and Cleaning the Data
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

To initially download the candy survey data, I used a short Rscript command within my [Makefile](Makefile). The excel spreadsheet data is downloaded into the subdirectory called `DataFiles`, to keep things neat.

From there, I call the first real R script called [Clean_candy_data.r](Clean_candy_data.r). In that script, I take the ugly excel spreadsheet and remove the questions I didn't feel like working with. I only kept the data about people's candy preferences and their age. I converted the strings `JOY/DESPAIR` into logical `TRUE/FALSE` so that it would be easier to work with. Below I show the structure of the output file of this script, which I saved as a `.rds` file.
```{r}
candies_clean <- readRDS("./DataFiles/Clean_candy_wide.rds")
str(candies_clean, max.level = 1, list.len=10 ) %>% head(10)
```

## Manipulating the Data
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

The next script, called [Manipulate_candy_data.r](Manipulate_candy_data.r), takes the output of the previous script and converts the data into two different data frames. One is broken down by age, and shows the ratio of people who wrote `JOY` vs `DESPAIR` for each candy. The other data frame does not group by age. It is simply a long data frame of the total Joy-Despair Ratio for each candy type. Below I show a glimpse of how the outputs look:
```{r}
candies_grouped <- readRDS("./DataFiles/Ratios_Group_Age.rds")
candies_ungrouped <- readRDS("./DataFiles/Ratios_No_Group.rds")

candies_grouped %>% head(10) %>%
	knitr::kable()

candies_ungrouped %>% head(10) %>%
	knitr::kable()
```

## Plotting the Data
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

My last workhorse script is called [Plot_candy_data.r](Plot_candy_data.r). It takes the input from the previous script, does a little bit more data rearrangement, and then creates two beautiful plots. If you want to understand how the script works, it is best to just look at it. I tried to comment it as best as I could. Here are the two plots that I created using that script.

!['Candy Popularity by Type'](DataFiles/CandyPop_By_Candy.png)

From this we can conclude that everyone's favorite candy to get on Halloween is a full-sized chocolate bar. Everyone's least favourite thing is a broken glow stick.

## One Script to Rule Them All
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

To tie everything together, I also made a `Makefile` script that automates the entire data analysis process. You can view it [here](Makefile).
