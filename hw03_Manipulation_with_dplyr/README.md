Welcome the homework 3 section of my repository. In this section, I explore the gapminder dataset using `ggplot2` and `dplyr` packages. A link to the assignment itself can be found on the [STAT545 website](http://stat545.com/hw03_dplyr-and-more-ggplot2.html).

Progress Report
---------------

I had a lot of trouble with the first section of the assignment. I really wanted to show a bar plot of minimum and maximum GDP per capita for each continent on the same plot, but struggled to find a way to do it using only `dplyr` functions. In the end, I gave up and downloaded another library with the function I needed. If there is a way of making the plot I made using only `dplyr` functions I would love to know how!

I spent a lot more time on that first plot than on any other one, as I had to explore the use of theme elements and figure out the syntax for editing labels and titles. A lot of googling was involved with the making of this plot. Luckily I have programming experience with other languages, so using the `for` loop to make exactly the y labels I wanted wasn't too challenging.

Two resources I found very useful in the making of this assignment were [dplyr cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf) and the [ggplot cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf).
