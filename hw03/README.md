Progress Report
---------------

I make all files for the STAT 545 course using Rstudio, which I have syched to my Github account. For the markdown files, I start with an R markdown document, which I knit into markdown. Git makes version control a breeze, and allows me to access my files accross multiple devices. Git also acts as a conventient back-up, in case files are lost on my local machine.
