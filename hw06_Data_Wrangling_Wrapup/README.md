Welcome the homework 6 section of my repository. In this section, I conclude my work on data wrangling with R. A link to the assignment itself can be found on the [STAT545 website](http://stat545.com/hw06_data-wrangling-conclusion.html).

Progress Report
---------------

This was a doozy of an assignment, it took way longer than any of the other ones so far! I didn't find that the first part of the assignment was super difficult for the most part. The text I followed was an excellent teacher for learning to use regular expressions. There were certain questions that I had to think a lot about such as "Are there any words that contain at least one of each different vowel?". That question required a good bit of googling around, but I was never stumped for too long. Usually a quick search of the problem brought back a useful explanation that was enough to answer my question.

For part two I strugged for a long time to figure out how to properly fit a quadratic model to data. I had to follow along with the resource found below "Curvilinear Regression" to finally figure it out. After building the core functionality it was just a matter of scaling it up with a `for` loop that looped over all countries in the dataset.


Some helpful resources I used:

- [Regular-expressions.info](https://www.regular-expressions.info/)

- [Differences between American and British written English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_differences)

- [Curvilinear Regression](https://rcompanion.org/rcompanion/e_03.html)
